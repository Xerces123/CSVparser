# CSVparser
Creator of parsers from CSV files to InsERT nexo objects

mKonto.CSV is a example file which can be used in parser add/edition window to help establish a proper separator

At present time there are funcions to add/edit parsers, but there is no funcion to parse files itself.
There also very little validation so be carefull and enter only proper values to fields and don't leave them empty where they cannot be.
